Step 1: Prerequisites
Before you start, ensure you have the following installed:

Flutter SDK: Install the latest stable version of Flutter from the Flutter website.

Dart SDK: Included with the Flutter SDK.

Android Studio or VS Code: While you can use other IDEs, Android Studio and VS Code offer great support for Flutter development.

Git: Necessary for cloning the repository.

Step 2: Clone the Repository
Open your terminal or command prompt.

Navigate to the directory where you want to clone the repository.

Run the following command:


Copy

Copy
 git clone [URL of the GitHub repository]
Replace [URL of the GitHub repository] with the actual URL.

Step 3: Open and Prepare the Project
Open the project in your preferred IDE (Android Studio or VS Code).

In the terminal of your IDE, run the following command to fetch all the necessary packages:


Copy

Copy
 flutter pub get
If the project includes native code or specific platform-dependent features, ensure the corresponding development tools for each platform (Xcode for iOS, Android SDK for Android) are set up correctly.

Step 4: Check for Gradle Issues
Gradle is a powerful build tool used primarily for Android projects. Flutter uses Gradle to manage dependencies, SDK versions, and build settings for Android.

Navigate to the android/ directory within your project folder.

Make sure the gradle-wrapper.properties file points to a valid Gradle distribution URL suitable for your project.

Review the build.gradle files (both project-level and app-level) for any potential issues such as:

Outdated dependencies

SDK version conflicts

Plugin versions not supporting your Gradle version

Step 5: Run the App
Connect a physical device or set up an emulator.

To ensure the IDE and connected device are ready, run:


Copy

Copy
 flutter doctor
This command checks your environment and displays a report of the status of your Flutter installation.

Execute the following command to run the app:


Copy

Copy
 flutter run
